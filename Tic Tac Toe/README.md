This is my second project that JavaScript is used. I learned many methods from creating it.
It's a Tic Tac Toe game but computer moves are not calculated, it's all random, which is not quite good.
The code is repetitive, and I can fix it but not doing, because currently, proceeding to other projects that I can learn much from is better for me.
