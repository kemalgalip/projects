This was my first project using JavaScript, that's why the CSS code was a little complicated (I focused on JS too much) and JS code was very repetitive.
In this newer version, I made CSS code a bit easier to read, and JS code much more efficient with DRY method.
For loops and switch statements were used to shorten it up. It was a fantastic practice for me.
