This is my 4th project using JavaScript. So far, the fist project taught me many different methods and functions.
I learned how to use:
-Timeout and interval functions on click and hold,
-Touchscreen event listeners
-Audio files and loop.
Apart from these, the best practice was creating a pop-up.
